# Find the sum
- Ask the user for a name of a file. If the file does not exist, ask for another file until the file exists.
- Read each line of the file and parse it into a double. If the line cannot be parsed into a double, consider that double to be 0 (use Exception handling).
- Output the sum of all of the doubles to System.out.
